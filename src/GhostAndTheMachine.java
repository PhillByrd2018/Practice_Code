//You are playing a simplified Pacman game. You start at the point (0, 0), and your destination is (target[0], target[1]).
// There are several ghosts on the map, the i-th ghost starts at (ghosts[i][0], ghosts[i][1]).
//
//Each turn, you and all ghosts simultaneously *may* move in one of 4 cardinal directions:
// north, east, west, or south, going from the previous point to a new point 1 unit of distance away.
//
//You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches
// you (for any given moves the ghosts may take.)  If you reach any square (including the target) at the same
// time as a ghost, it doesn't count as an escape.
//
//Return True if and only if it is possible to escape.



//make a main
    //make a test variable List<List>
        //one true expected
        //one false expected
    //make an object
    //use the object to call the function, pass the test value list


//make a function that takes in a list of lists & a target position || and returns a boolean based on
// if a pacman ghost can catch you before you can leave.
